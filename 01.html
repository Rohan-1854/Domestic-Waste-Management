    <h1>Ecosystem</h1> 

Domestic waste management rules were introduced in India in 2011, keeping in mind the dominant role of informal sector and the health and safety challenges that come 
along with informal handling of e-waste. These rules came into effect from 1 May 2012. Later, e-waste management rules were notified in 2016 in response to 
implementation issues and other shortcomings of 2011 rules. These rules came into effect from October 2016. These rules were further amended in March 2018.

<h1>Objectives</h1>

Environmentally sound and safe management of e-waste
Promote sustainable technologies through authorized dismantlers and recyclers.
Implement Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) (as mentioned in 2016 rules). The EPR mechanism lays emphasis on producers’ responsibility for environmentally 
sound management of e-waste.
Control and minimize e-waste handling and recycling by the informal sector.
Promote the establishment of an efficient e-waste collection mechanism, through buy-back and take-back systems.
<h1>Stakeholders</h1>

The Rules specifies various stakeholders and their respective responsibilities and activities that each of them needs to perform, right from seeking 
authorization to maintaining records and filing annual returns.

<h1>Producers </h1>
Dismantlers, recyclers, manufacturers and refurbishers
Dealers

E-waste recycling process and role of technology

The process of e-waste recycling primarily involves two stages – 

Manual collection and processing – sorting, separating, cleaning, emptying, dismantling and segregation
Mechanical processing – shredding, grinding etc. and selective treatment
Given that e-waste recycling involves many such stages and processes, role of technologies in this space becomes crucial to ensure sustainable and timely 
recycling of e-waste. 

Many public R&D labs in India such as CIPET, CSIR-NML, C-MET Hyderabad, CSIR-NEERI etc. are working in this space and have also developed various technologies 
focusing on dismantling and segregation, processing of printed circuit boards, recovery of rare earth metals, plastic recycling etc.

One of the premier research institutions, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) has developed several highly energy efficient and cost-effective e-waste recycling
technologies, making them commercially viable. Some of these technologies include separation of high purity individual rare earths from primary as well as 
secondary resources, production of rare-earth value-added products such as RE metals, alloys and phosphorous and several technologies for recovery of REEs from 
recycling of electronic waste. 

Many of these technologies by BARC are ready for transfer to any organization/company operating in the e-waste management space. This endeavor aims to fulfill 
our ambitious e-waste recycling goals and contribute towards an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.

<h1>The SDG goals related to e-waste?</h1>
A better understanding and management of e-waste is closely linked to Goal 3 (Good health and Well-being), 
Goal 6 (Clean water and Sanitation), 
Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 
Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 
Goal 14 (Life Below Water), and 
Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).
