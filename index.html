<h1>Domestic waste collection and disposal</h1>

Domestic waste has become one of the most significant causes of severe damage to the rural eco-environment because of the large amounts of waste discharged 
and improper disposal (Wang and Lu, 2006). In order to eliminate contaminations from domestic waste, a waste management system including waste collection, 
transportation, and treatment have been established. First, a waste treatment and disposal plan was made to restrict improper disposal and clean up of 
existing piles of waste near canals, roads, and houses. Second, a domestic waste treatment collection network, including certain numbers of waste collection
sites and transfer stations, was built in big villages and counties. Third, waste reclamation technologies, such as methane fermentation, composting, and the
production of compound fertilizers, were developed and applied.
